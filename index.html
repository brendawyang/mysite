		<p>The landscape of our memories is constructed from more than things that really happened. We also imagine worlds that never existed and people we've never met. I am fascinated by how and why we consume, remember, and share works of narrative fiction (such as books, movies, and TV shows). My work explores the ways that <i>memories of fiction</i> can be considered part of the autobiographical record.</p>

	  <p>How do we decide what to believe and remember? We consider novel forces that shape belief, including asymmetries in believing and unbelieving, the impermanance of qualifying language, and the weak contributions of reasons in changing people's minds. We also summarize findings from cognitive science, such as the theme that we are easily swayed by cognitive shortcuts and prior beliefs, for interdisciplinary audiences.  </p>

        <p>I came to graduate school by way of being an educator. My teaching style is intentional, reflective, innovative, and joyful. I am experienced in developing student-centered curriculum differentiated for a wide range of skills, and centering classroom instruction on the lived realities of students. I am always seeking ways to grow. My goal in teaching is always to help students reveal their own potential to themselves.</p>

			It was actually a class I would look forward to going to... and it even caused me to have <b>discussions with my non-psych major friends afterwards</b> about concepts. Each powerpoint, in class activity, lab, and assignment was very well thought out, but also engaging. Most importantly, <b>your enthusiasm</b> for the subject and dedication to educating us made this class one of my favorites I have ever taken. The classroom was such a <b>comfortable environment, right from stepping inside of it</b>. Before starting Cognitive Psych, I viewed it more as a major requirement, but I can honestly say that <b>this class has changed the way I think</b>, and I know from talking to classmates that I am not the only one that you have had an impact on.

			I really enjoy the layout of the class. The powerpoints are very engaging and well made, which helps everyone pay attention and stay focused. I also enjoy how comfortable the class environment is. <b>People don't have to worry about saying the wrong answer or asking a question when they don't understand</b>, which helps facilitate learning.

			Brenda encouraged each of the teaching fellows to put themselves in the shoes of their students – showing them <b>compassion, grace, and empathy</b>. At the same time, however, she also reminded us how important it is to hold your students to high expectations, noting that they often rise to these expectations, especially when the classroom goals and guidelines work to properly support them.

			Brenda was an excellent instructor for the course. She was always very friendly and made you feel very comfortable in the discussion section. ... She always explained things very clearly and was obviously organized, and I greatly enjoyed having her as a resource and instructor throughout the duration of the course. She was very effectively able to turn the discussion section into a closer and more personal setting than would otherwise be found within the bigger lecture hall.

		<p>Mentorship is one of the most important practices of science and a skill I take pride in cultivating. My goals in mentoring students and young researchers is to help them clarify and realize their own goals through rigor- and curiosity-driven engagement with the scientific process. One of my great joys is also mentoring and coaching others in teaching and pedagogy.</p>

		<h5>Creating systems that foster excellent mentorship</h5>
		<p>I believe that great mentors are not born, but made. During graduate school, I took concrete steps to help make excellent mentoring practices more accessible to all. This included, spearheading the creation of the department's first <a href="https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/mentoring-handbook">Mentoring Handbook</a>.</p>
		
		<p>In April 2019, I co-developed and co-led four, two-hour sessions focused on the fundamental principles of a good mentoring relationship as part of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences (DIBS) ongoing Inclusion and Power Dynamics series. The workshops were planned and led in collaboration with <a href="https://bbs.utdallas.edu/faculty/detail.php5?i=2034">Kendra Seaman</a>, a post-doc at the time who is now faculty at UT Dallas.</p>

			Brenda was <b>a phenomenal resource and source of wisdom</b> for me... Not only was she able to provide me with tangible and action-based tips, but she was constantly checking-in to see if she could lend a hand or offer motivation. Brenda was, and continues to be, <b>extremely intentional</b> in her relationships with her mentees and students, and I have greatly benefitted from her thoughtfulness. (Psy101 Teaching Fellow)</li>
			<li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left text-warning"></i></span>
			Brenda has always been an amazing mentor to me... She is a <b>role model</b> for me with her passion for psychology, her strong work ethic, and her never-ending enthusiasm for life. (Mentee)</li>
			<li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left text-warning"></i></span>
			Brenda is an amazing mentor to undergraduate students... She works closely with undergraduates and manages to provide <b>both freedom and guidance</b>. (Mentor) </li>
			<li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left text-warning"></i></span>
			This workshop was such an incredible resource... You could tell how much they cared about mentoring. I learned so much, and I have gained the confidence to have sometimes difficult conversations with mentees. What I learned here has <b>completely transformed</b> my approach to mentorship, and I feel empowered to continue learning and growing. Mentorship is at the heat of science as an apprenticeship, so I feel like <b>this workshop should be required of every mentor</b> (or anyone who wants to be one)!
